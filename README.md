# VITS Fast Fine-tuning
This repo will guide you to add your own character voices, or even your own voice, into existing VITS TTS model
to make it able to do the following tasks in less than 1 hour:  

1. Many-to-many voice conversion between any characters you added & preset characters in the model.
2. English, Japanese & Chinese Text-to-Speech synthesis with the characters you added & preset characters  
  

Welcome to play around with the base models!
